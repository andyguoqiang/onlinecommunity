Social presence is the complete and interactive educational experience of participants in the didactic process. When participants in an online course help establish a community of learning by projecting their personal characteristics into the discussion or other activities, they present themselves as real people.<br />
Cognitive presence is the extent to which the professor and the students are able to construct and affirm meaning through sustained discourse (discussion) in a community of inquiry. It is a vital element in enhancing critical thinking. Cognitive presence can be demonstrated by introducing factual, conceptual, and theoretical knowledge into the discussion.<br />
